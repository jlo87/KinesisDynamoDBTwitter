# KinesisDynamoDBTwitter
 
In this project, we take Twitter data, put it into a Kinesis Stream, extract hashtags and load into DynamoDB.

Setting up infrastructure to handle large amounts of data to collect and process data in realtime can be quite simple when deployed using the serverless products currently available. This tutorial gave an introduction to using AWS managed services to ingest and store Twitter data using Kinesis and DynamoDB.

TODO: Use AWS Lambda for more scalable comsumption of data. Add extra shards and partition by hashtag.
